                      <li>Our shipments go through rigorous quality checks before 
                          they leave our partner warehouses. However, in the rare case 
                          that your product is damaged during shipment or transit,
                           you can request a replacement or cancellation and refund.</li>

                      <li>If you have received an item in a damaged/defective condition,
                           or have been sent the wrong product, you can follow a few simple steps 
                           to initiate your return/refund within 5 days of receiving the order:
                        Step 1: Contact our customer support team via email (<strong><a href="">(support@meanbuy.com)</a></strong>) 
                        within 5 business days of receiving the order.</li>

                           to return/replace/refund the defective/wrong items in your order. 
                           Kindly share an image 
                          of the product and the invoice for our reference.</li>

                      <li>Step 3: We will pick up the products within 2-4 business days.
                        The refund or replacement will be initiated only if the products 
                        are received by us in their original packaging with their seals, labels,
                         and barcodes intact.</li>

                      <li><strong>Note:</strong> If it is a case of replacement, it is subject to the availability of stock. 
                          In case a replacement may not be available,
                           we will refund you the full amount.</li>

                      <strong>Do I have to return the free gift when I return a product?</strong>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Yes. The free gift is included as a part of the item 
                          ordered and needs to be returned along with the product
                           originally delivered.</li>

                           and if you have ordered multiple items, 
                           you can initiate a return/replacement/refund for any individual item. 
                           However, any product being returned needs to be returned in full, 
                           including all components,
